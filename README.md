# STS Project EDA in Tableau

Keynotes:
1. Preprocessed the data in Python
	- Missing values were replaced by median in case of numerical variables and mode in case of categorical variables.

2. Loaded preprocessed data in Tableau Desktop
3. Changed default aggregation of measures from sum to average because they are measured in average over a period of time.
